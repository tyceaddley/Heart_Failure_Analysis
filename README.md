# Heart_Failure_Analysis
An analysis of Kaggle data set for factors leading to heart failure in patients
The data set used is available on kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
Cardiovascular disease deaths are most commonly caused by heart failure and the data analyzed shows several risk factors associated with premature death. Some included are tobacco use, diabetes, and blood composition molecules such as creatinine.

# Modeling
Several machine learning algorithms are used and evaluated with specificity and sensitivity measures.
Random Forest generated the best model with ROC and higher accuracy than other models tested.
